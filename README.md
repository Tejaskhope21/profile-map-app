Profile Explorer Web Application
This project is a web application built with React that allows users to view a list of profiles, explore their geographic locations on an interactive map, and manage profile data. The application is designed to provide an intuitive, responsive, and user-friendly experience for navigating profiles and visualizing associated addresses.
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
Features

Profile Display: View a collection of profiles with details such as name, photograph, and a brief description.
Interactive Mapping: Dynamically display profile addresses on an interactive map using Mapbox or Google Maps integration.
Summary Integration: Click a "Summary" button next to each profile to display the profile's address on the map with a marker.
Profile Data Management: Admin panel to add, edit, or delete profiles.
Search and Filter Functionality: Search and filter profiles by name, location, or other attributes.
Responsive Design: Fully responsive UI for seamless use on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Error Handling: Robust error handling for invalid addresses or failed map service requests.
Loading Indicators: Visual feedback with loading indicators during data fetching or map rendering.
Profile Details View: Detailed view for each profile, including additional information like contact details and interests.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.You may also see any lint errors in the console.
npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.See the section about running tests for more information.
npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about deployment for more information.
npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
